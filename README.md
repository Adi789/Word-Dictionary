# Word-Dictionary
English language dictionary with search and suggestions.

This dictionary contains a preloaded json data which contains the word and their meaning.
There is a main function which checks user input word and provides associated meaning.
  
  If the word is misspelled, then it will provide a nearest match using Python difflib library and then provide the meaning to the user.
  The challenge here was to output several meanings in a different line because they are dictionary values.
  I extracted individual meaning using join and loop. You will find it once you open it!!
  
 Thanks,
